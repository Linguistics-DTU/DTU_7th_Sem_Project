## 7th Semester Project

PEOPLE’S RECEPTION OF THE BANNING SPREE IN INDIA

November 2015

* We explored the correlations between the various Census data about a particular stateand the general ”acceptance” of a particular ban.

* The analysis was done using the Twitter API and the Indian Census data of 2011

* Gained extensive knowledge of various Python libraries like,

- For natural language processing 

- Natural Language ToolKit (NLTK)

- For visualization and big-data analysis - Pandas, NumPy, Bokeh

### The Result of the entire analysis were a couple iPython notebooks with interactive visualizations
